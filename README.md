This project can calculate phase curve of exoplanet in different surface conditions, such as specular and lambert surface.

Phase curve can be calculated by simulation or a complex integration or a simple optical principle, but only the simulation and original integration are accurate.

This project is still under construction... So this README is only a very brief introduction.
